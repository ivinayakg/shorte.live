# Intro

## Getting Started

- First fork this project.
- Follow the setup from the [README](https://github.com/ivinayakg/shorte.live/blob/v2/README.md) file to set it up locally.
- and done.

## Rules

- Keep things neat and clean.
- Have proper issue ticket or any public document, which explains your work thoroughly.
- Before raising your PR run your **tests on your local system**. Only after there are no errors on your local, please push your code.
- Every PR must have tests for the code written. (for now backend only, as I'm currently setting up the frontend testing architecture)

## Running tests on local

- Simply open your terminal, change to `api` directory with `cd api`.
- Run
  ```
  go test ./tests/integration
  go test ./tests/unit
  ```
